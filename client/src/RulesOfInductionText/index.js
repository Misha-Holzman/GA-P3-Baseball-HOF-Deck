            In 2014, the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum amended the
            election rules. Going forward, the maximum years of consideration
            for a player who meets that criteria is now 10 years. Candidates
            would then move to the Era Committee system for review in
            perpetuity. Three candidates who were at that time on the BBWAA (the
            Baseball Writers' Association of America) ballot in years 10-15 were
            grandfathered into this system and remained under consideration by
            the BBWAA for up to the full 15 years. Don Mattingly (15th year in
            2015), Alan Trammell (14th year in 2015) and Lee Smith (13th year in
            2015) were eligible to remain on the BBWAA ballot for a maximum of
            15 years of consideration.

            BBWAA members earn a Hall of Fame vote from its organization, which
            is independent of the Hall of Fame, by maintaining 10 consecutive
            years on a baseball beat. Those Hall of Fame eligible voters are
            required to complete a registration form and sign a code of conduct.
            Potential Hall of Fame voters must meet requirements as active
            members covering the game, with a 10-year grace period for those no
            longer active. The names of those BBWAA members casting Hall of Fame
            ballots are made public with the election results; however, an
            individualâ€™s ballot will not be revealed by the Hall of Fame.
